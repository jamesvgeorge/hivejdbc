Interactive Hive JDBC Client
This is a simple, command-line Java application that provides an interactive shell to connect to and query an Apache Hive database using the Cloudera JDBC driver. It is specifically configured to connect to a Hive instance that uses ZooKeeper for service discovery.

Features
Interactive Shell: Run HiveQL queries in a loop without restarting the application.

Dynamic Result Display: Automatically formats and prints query results to the console.

Server-Side Execution Log Fetching: Captures the detailed execution logs generated by the Hive server for each query.

YARN Application ID Discovery: Automatically finds and displays the application_... ID for each query, making it easy to track jobs in the YARN ResourceManager.

Detailed Logging:

Execution Logs: Server-side logs for each query are saved to ./logs/execution.log and are overwritten with each new query.

Driver Logs: Verbose (TRACE level) client-side driver logs are saved to ./logs/HiveJDBC_*.log.

Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or later. You can verify your installation by running java -version.

Cloudera JDBC Driver for Apache Hive: The HiveJDBC42.jar file is required. This project assumes you have downloaded the driver ZIP file from Cloudera.

Setup
Clone the Repository:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>

Create Project Directories:
The source code is located in src/com/example/. You need to create directories for the compiled code, libraries, and logs.

mkdir lib
mkdir logs

Add the Cloudera JDBC Driver:
Place your HiveJDBC42.jar file inside the lib/ directory.

Compilation
Compile the Java source code from the root directory of the project using the following command:

javac -cp "lib/*" -d . src/com/example/HiveJdbcClient.java

-cp "lib/*": Includes the Hive JDBC driver in the classpath.

-d .: Places the compiled .class files in the current directory, maintaining the package structure.

Running the Application
Execute the compiled application from the root directory of the project:

java -cp ".:lib/*" com.example.HiveJdbcClient

Once started, you will see a hive> prompt. You can now type your HiveQL queries and press Enter.

Example Session:

Starting Interactive Hive JDBC Client...
Connecting to: jdbc:hive2://zk=ccycloud-2.nightly7x-us-hr.root.comops.site:2181/hiveserver2;LogLevel=6;LogPath=./logs
Successfully connected to Hive. Type 'quit' or 'exit' to terminate.
hive> select min(code) from web_logs where code < 302;
Execution logs will be overwritten in ./logs/execution.log
YARN Application ID: application_1660314854743_0001

1 row(s) returned.
hive> quit
Exiting client.

Output and Logging
Console Output: The application will print status messages, query results, and the YARN Application ID directly to your terminal.

Execution Logs: For each query you run, the detailed server-side execution logs are saved to ./logs/execution.log. This file is overwritten on every run.

Driver Logs: The verbose client-side JDBC driver logs are saved in the ./logs/ directory, typically in files named HiveJDBC_driver.log and HiveJDBC_connection_*.log.
